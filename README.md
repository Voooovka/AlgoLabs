Search in width

Your task will be to implement a width search algorithm to specify the oriented graph and the starting vertex s. The results of the algorithm should be the length of the path (the number of edges to be traversed) from the vertex to the farthest vertex (which can still be achieved with vertices s).


Incoming data:
The first line contains the numbers N - the number of edges and s - the initial vertex. The next N lines include pairs of vertices connected by an edge.
 
Output data:
The length of the path to the farthest peak.

Limitation:
0 <N <= 10000
